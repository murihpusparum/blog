> Four days with Apple's new laptop for pros  

On Thursday morning last week, Apple sent me a review unit of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for testing. I've been using it almost non-stop since, to try to put it through its paces and evaluate this latest power laptop from Apple. I've only had four days with it, and so this is probably best seen as a set of early impressions rather than a thoroughgoing review, but here are my thoughts on using it so far. I'll cover quite a few bases here, but my main focus will be on addressing two particular issues which I suspect people will have the most questions about: the Touch Bar and the power of this computer to do heavy duty work.  

## The model I'm using  
In short, this is the 15-inch version, with 16GB of RAM, but it's not the highest-end model. There is a version with a 2.9GHz processor and a Radeon Pro 460 graphics card, which would be a good bit more powerful for some tasks than the machine I'm using, though the RAM on that computer is the same. I'm coming to this experience from using two main Macs over the past couple of years. When I'm at my desk, I'm typically using a 2010-version Mac Pro with 32GB of RAM, a processor with 12 2.66GHz cores, a massive SSD, and a Radeon GPU. When I'm mobile, I'm using a MacBook Air from a couple of years ago, with 4GB of memory and an Intel graphics card. In most respects, at least on paper, this MBP is a big step up on the MBA, but is less powerful than the Mac Pro, with the exception of the graphics card.  

## The Touch Bar  
So let's start with the Touch Bar. I had a chance to play around with the Touch Bar a bit at the launch event, and found it intriguing. It was already clear then that this was the kind of feature that could save time and make workflows easier if done right, but that would also come with a learning curve, and my first few days using it more intensively have confirmed both of those perceptions.  

## An analogy  
The best analogy I can think of is learning to touch type. My oldest daughter has recently gone through this process, and I remember going through it when I was about the same age. Before you start learning, you've probably got pretty good at the hunt-and-peck method, and may even be quite fast. When you start learning to touch type, a lot of it is about forcing yourself to change your habits, which can be painful. At first, you're probably slower than before, and the temptation is to go back to doing what you've always done, because if feels like you're going backwards. But over time, as you master the skill, you get faster and faster, and it feels even more natural. You're also able to stay in the flow much better, watching the screen rather than the keys. Learning to use the Touch Bar is a lot like that. If you already use a Mac regularly, you likely have pretty well-established workflows, combining mouse or trackpad actions, typing, and keyboard shortcuts. Suddenly, the Touch Bar comes along and gives you new ways of doing some of the things you've always done a certain way. A few may replace keyboard shortcuts, but the vast majority will instead be replacements for mouse or trackpad actions. The first step is remembering that these options are now available. The Touch Bar is quite bright enough to see in any lighting conditions, but it's not intended to be distracting, so although you may be vaguely aware of it in your peripheral vision as you're looking at the screen, it doesn't draw your eye. You have to consciously remember to use it, a bit like how you have to consciously remember to use all your fingers when you're learning to touch type. At first, your instinct is to just keep doing things the way you've always done them. But then you start to realize that the repetitive task you're doing by moving the mouse cursor away from the object you're working with to the taskbar or to the Format pane at the side of the window could be accomplished much more easily by just pressing a button in the Touch Bar. You try it and it works great. The next time you do it a little more quickly, and pretty soon it's a habit. That first couple of times it may take more time than your old method, because you're having to break the old habit, but you quickly develop a new, more efficient, habit. Your mouse cursor stays by the object you're working with (or out of the way entirely) and you go on with your work. I've been integrating the Touch Bar into some of my workflows over the last few days, and it's now starting to become natural and I'm getting to the stage where things are faster than they were before. Below are some samples that show the adaptability of the Touch Bar:  

This adaptability is one of the strengths of the Touch Bar — the way it morphs not just between apps but based on the context within each app too. The video below shows several examples in quick succession as I move between apps and between contexts within apps. You'll see how rapidly it changes as I go through these (there's no sound on the video). Most of the buttons are either self-explanatory or familiar enough to be intuitive, but I did find a couple of cases where I simply had no idea what a button meant. Since you can't hover over these buttons in the way you can an on-screen button, there's really no way to find out either, which can be tricky. Ultimately, as I've [written previously][4], the Touch Bar represents a different philosophical approach to touch on laptops by Apple compared with Microsoft's all-touch approach to computers. I've used a few Windows laptops with touch, and though there have been times when it was useful, it's often frustrating – the screen tends to bounce away from you when you jab it with your finger and touch targets are often too small. Apple's approach keeps the horizontal and vertical planes separate – the vertical plane on a MacBook is purely a display, while the horizontal plane is the one you interact with. This is easier on your hands and arms, and allows you to work more quickly because everything is within easy reach. The trackpads on Apple's laptops have brought some of the benefits of touch to laptops over the last few years, and the Touch Bar takes this a step further.  

## Third party support  
For now, the Touch Bar is only available in first-party applications on the Mac, and most of Apple's own apps now support it. However, if you're a typical Mac user it's quite likely that you spend a fair amount of time in third-party apps, and that's certainly the case with me. I spend a lot of my time on the Mac in Tweetbot and Evernote, for example, neither of which support the Touch Bar yet, except for auto-correction when typing, which is universal. Apple demoed some third party apps with Touch Bar integration at its launch event, and below is a table of those apps whose developers have committed to supporting it so far:  

For now, users will be able to take advantage of Touch Bar inside the Apple apps and a handful of others, and that will mean adapting some workflows but not others. The experience here is going to be like the early days of 3D Touch support on the iPhone – it will be nice to have for the apps where it's available, but there will be a lot of apps where it doesn't work yet. In some cases, that's going to push users towards apps that do support the feature, as was the case with 3D Touch. And since support is relatively easy to build, I would guess many developers will get on board quickly once the laptops are out.  

## Touch ID  
Since the Touch ID sensor is part of the Touch Bar strip, it's worth mentioning that briefly too. For anyone who's used Touch ID on an iPhone or iPad, the value proposition will be fairly obvious – this is a great way to unlock your device without using a password. To be sure, people probably unlock their laptops many fewer times per day than they do their phones, but it's still a handy time-saver. I've had Apple Watch unlock set up on my MacBook Air for a few weeks, and found that useful, but didn't feel the need to set it up on this MacBook Pro because Touch ID is actually faster. But Touch ID goes beyond just unlocking — it can also be used for various other functions where you'd normally enter your system password, including certain app installations and system changes. When it's available, an indicator shows up in the Touch Bar strip pointing to the sensor, which is handy, because it can't always be used in place of a password.  

## Siri  
It's also worth discussing the Siri button that's part of the Touch Bar too. I've been using Sierra on my existing Macs for a couple of months now, but haven't made much use of Siri, in part because I can never remember which hot key I've set to invoke it, and clicking on the on-screen Siri button in the taskbar is too much trouble. Having a dedicated Siri button is definitely making me use Siri more.  

## Power and performance  
On, then, to power and performance. I gave you the specs for the machine I'm testing earlier – it's not the top of the line model, but given some of the commentary from the professional community and those claiming to speak on their behalf over the last couple of weeks, I wanted to put this side of the MacBook Pro to the test.
