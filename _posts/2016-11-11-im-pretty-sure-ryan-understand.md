I'm pretty sure Speaker Ryan understands that the alliances of the GOP with Libertarians in the late 40's, unrequited segregationist whites via the Southern Strategy in 1969, and social-religious conservatives in the 1970's are falling apart. Clearly, the GOP needs a new ideology to remain politically relevant. This isn't 1979 when the top federal marginal tax rate was well north of 50%. But any ideological change will mean switching its current and numerically declining voter base for another one.

But voters who make up a party's base can linger like a bad hangover for years, even intensify for a period as moderate voters migrate away, and therefore make any changes to a party's ideology painful. As an example, look no farther than what the Democratic Party experienced in the early 70's through the early 90's while it shook-off its counter-culture and radical elements. During that transition were some rough primaries — who can forget Ted Kennedy's refusal to embrace and back President Carter at the 1980 Democratic Convention — and pretty stunning presidential losses in 1980, 1984, and 1988 as more moderate voters abandoned the Democratic party in droves to become Reagan Democrats. But the transition of the Democratic party was eventually successful, as reflected in the election of Bill Clinton in 1992 and cemented by his 1996 re-election.

It's just my opinion, but I think the GOP's weak leadership makes any ideology transition for the GOP more difficult than was the case for Democrats. Donors like Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers will continue to fund candidates with positions contra to what GOP reformers might want. Social silo'ing today of Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, and Alex Jones cacoons GOP base voters into ignoring the inevitable and drags-out any ideological transition by the GOP. Lastly, I think the retching stench cast by Trump and his enablers will repulse emerging voters for several years, perhaps a decade, maybe more.
